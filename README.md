# ecommerce

## Description

This application is a back-end only program where users can use Insomnia to read all the data, select what data they want to see, update, post, and delete data. Specifically, this is an ecommerce back end application that holds data about cetegories, products, tags, prices, stock, etc. The application makes use of get, post, put, and delete routes to gather and change items in the database of the ecommerce application. My motivation for this application is that ecommerce needs an functional, organized database that will allow the respective company to add items to their database, update items, delete items, and see their items. I built this project to familiarize myself with mySQL and Insonmia but also to practice my back end coding skills. The problem this application solves is having the back end for any kind of eccomerce website. Having all the data and routes set up correctly is important to any selling website. I learned that Insomnia is a great tool to check routes and that most routes follow the same patterns.
